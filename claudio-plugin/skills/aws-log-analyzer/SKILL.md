# AWS Log Analyzer

## Overview

Troubleshoot and analyze logs from AWS CloudWatch Logs - AWS's centralized logging service for applications and infrastructure.

**Prerequisites:**
- `aws` CLI is installed and configured
- User is already authenticated (via IAM credentials, SSO, or instance profile)
- Appropriate IAM permissions for CloudWatch Logs read operations

**Installation:**
Use the centralized tool installation scripts:

```bash
# Check and install AWS CLI (required)
../../../tools/aws-cli/install.sh

# Check and install jq (optional, recommended)
../../../tools/jq/install.sh
```

## Core Concepts

- **Log Group**: Container for log streams (typically one per application/service)
- **Log Stream**: Sequence of log events from a single source (e.g., instance, container)
- **Log Event**: Individual log entry with timestamp and message
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights**: SQL-like query language for advanced log analysis

## Analysis Philosophy

**Always follow this pattern:**
1. Start broad → identify the problem scope
2. Narrow down → focus on specific errors or patterns
3. Filter noise → exclude known non-critical errors
4. Analyze distribution → understand when errors occur

**Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for all error analysis** - it supports case-insensitive regex, which is essential because logs may contain "error", "Error", or "ERROR" in different formats.

## Output Format

**All scripts output JSON by default** to make results easy to parse programmatically by AI assistants and automation tools.

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: Use full JSON output for typical error analysis**

For most use cases, **direct JSON output is more efficient** than state management:
- ✅ Single round-trip - get all data in one call
- ✅ No state lookup complexity - data is immediately available
- ✅ Reliable - no session ID or file path issues
- ✅ For typical analyses (even 10K+ errors), JSON output is manageable (~30KB)

**Only use `--save-state` (via state management scripts) if:**
- You're analyzing 100K+ log entries
- The JSON output exceeds 100KB
- You need to reference the same data across multiple analysis steps over time

**Recommended approach - get all data in one call:**
```bash
# Run analysis and capture full JSON output
OUTPUT=$(./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24)

# Parse specific fields as needed
echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.total_errors'
echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.by_severity'
echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.top_errors[:5]'
```

### JSON Output (Default)

```bash
# Default: JSON output to stdout, progress to stderr
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24

# Output:
{
  "log_group": "/aws/app/myapp",
  "hours_analyzed": 24,
  "total_errors": "1247",
  "by_severity": {
    "critical": 15,
    "error": 1200,
    "warning": 25,
    "failed": 7
  },
  "top_errors": [
    {
      "message": "Connection timeout to database",
      "count": 342,
      "percentage": 27.43,
      "pattern": "Connection timeout to database"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "critical_errors": [...],
  "top_errors_by_pattern": [
    {
      "pattern": "Error at <TIMESTAMP>",
      "total_count": 450,
      "occurrences": 12,
      "examples": [
        {"message": "Error at 2026-02-06 15:30:45", "count": 120},
        {"message": "Error at 2026-02-06 16:45:12", "count": 95}
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "hourly_distribution": [...],
  "comparison": null  // or populated if --compare-previous is used
}
```

**With additional flags:**

```bash
# Exclude noise patterns and compare with previous period
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 --exclude-noise --compare-previous

# Output includes comparison data:
{
  ...
  "comparison": {
    "current_period": {"total_errors": 1247, "hours": 24},
    "previous_period": {"total_errors": 1050, "hours": 24},
    "change": "+18.76%",
    "trend": "increasing"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Structured data** - Easy to parse and extract specific fields
- **Clean separation** - Progress messages go to stderr, results to stdout
- **Consistent format** - All scripts use the same JSON structure pattern
- **AI-friendly** - Models can easily process and reason about JSON

### Human-Readable Output

Add `--human` flag for human-readable table/text format:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 --human

# Output:
=== Error Analysis Results ===
Log Group: /aws/app/myapp
Total Errors: 1247

Top Errors by Frequency:
  342x: Connection timeout to database
  125x: Authentication failed...
  ...
```

### Parsing JSON Output

**In the model context:**
```bash
# Extract specific field
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 | jq '.total_errors'

# Count distinct error types
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 | jq '.top_errors | length'

# Get top 3 errors
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 | jq '.top_errors[:3]'
```

---

## State Management

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: State management is for advanced use cases only**

The state management system (`~/.aws-log-analyzer/state/`) is available for very large datasets or multi-step workflows, but is **NOT recommended for typical error analysis**.

**Shared Library:** This skill uses `claudio-plugin/tools/memory/scripts/state.sh` - a shared state management library used across multiple skills.

**Why direct JSON output is better:**
- ✅ Simpler - no session IDs or file paths to manage
- ✅ Faster - single round-trip instead of save → view → parse
- ✅ More reliable - no file system dependencies
- ✅ Efficient even for 10K+ errors (~30KB JSON)

**Note:** `analyze_errors.sh` no longer supports the `--save-state` flag. Use direct JSON output instead (see examples above).

### Manual State Management (Advanced)

If you need state management for very large datasets (100K+ entries), you can manually save/load data:

```bash
# Capture output and save manually if needed
OUTPUT=$(./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24)
echo "$OUTPUT" > /tmp/analysis_result.json

# Later, load and parse
jq '.top_errors[:10]' /tmp/analysis_result.json
```

**View saved state:**

```bash
# List all saved states
./scripts/view_state.sh

# View specific state by ID
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors_1707224567

# View latest state for an operation
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors
```

### When to Use State

**Use `--save-state` when:**
- Working with the model and want to minimize token usage
- Results are large (thousands of log entries, many error types)
- Building multi-step workflows where later steps reference earlier results

**Don't use `--save-state` when:**
- Running scripts manually and want immediate full output
- Results are small and fit easily in context
- Doing one-off investigations

### Querying Saved State

**Once data is saved, you can extract specific information using jq:**

```bash
# Get the total error count
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.total_errors'

# Get top 5 errors with their counts
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors[0:5][] | {message: .message, count: .count}'

# Get only critical errors (count > 10)
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.critical_errors[] | select(.count > 10)'

# Get severity breakdown
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.by_severity'

# Get errors from a specific time bucket
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.hourly_distribution[] | select(.time_bucket | contains("2026-02-06T15"))'

# Extract error patterns (grouped by similarity)
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors_by_pattern[0:5]'

# Get all errors matching a specific pattern
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors[] | select(.pattern | contains("Connection"))'

# Get percentage of errors that are critical
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '(.by_severity.critical / (.total_errors | tonumber) * 100)'

# Compare current vs previous period (if --compare-previous was used)
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.comparison'

# Get examples of a specific error pattern
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors_by_pattern[0].examples'
```

**Example workflow using saved state:**

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze errors with state saving
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/myapp 24 --save-state --exclude-noise

# Output:
# {
#   "operation": "analyze_errors",
#   "state_saved": true,
#   "state_id": "analyze_errors_1738858234",
#   "summary": {
#     "log_group": "/aws/app/myapp",
#     "total_errors": 1247,
#     "top_error_patterns": [...]
#   }
# }

# Step 2: Query specific details without re-running analysis
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.by_severity'
# Output: {"critical": 15, "error": 1200, "warning": 25, "failed": 7}

# Step 3: Get top 3 error patterns
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors_by_pattern[0:3]'

# Step 4: Find all errors with high frequency (> 50 occurrences)
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors[] | select(.count > 50)'
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Analyze Errors in a Log Group

**User Request:** "Analyze errors for <log-group> in the last 24 hours"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run complete error analysis
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 24
```

**Output Provides:**
1. Total error count
2. Top error messages by frequency
3. Critical/unique errors (excludes noise)
4. Hourly error distribution

**Recommended approach - capture output and parse as needed:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run analysis and capture full JSON output
OUTPUT=$(./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 24)

# Step 2: Extract specific fields
echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.total_errors'
# Output: "1247"

echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.by_severity'
# Output: {"critical": 15, "error": 1200, "warning": 25, "failed": 7}

echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.top_errors[:3]'
# Output: Array of top 3 errors with counts and percentages

# Step 3: Get more details on specific errors if needed
./scripts/find_recent_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1 50
```

**Why this is efficient:**
- Single execution of analyze_errors.sh gets all data
- No round-trips to view state
- No session ID management
- For typical datasets (even 10K errors), JSON is ~30KB - completely manageable
- Parse different fields from the same output as needed

### Workflow 2: Investigate Errors (Unknown Log Group)

**User Request:** "Check for errors in my application"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: Find the log group
./scripts/list_log_groups.sh /aws/application

# Step 2: Analyze errors in the identified log group
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 24
```

---

### Workflow 3: Trace a Request Across Services

**User Request:** "Trace request ID abc-123 through all services"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Single command to search all log groups with a common prefix
./scripts/trace_request.sh abc-123 /aws/myapp 24
```

**Output:** Shows all log entries containing the request ID, sorted by timestamp, across all log groups.

---

### Workflow 4: Monitor for Specific Errors in Real-Time

**User Request:** "Watch for OutOfMemory errors in real-time"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Tail logs with filter pattern
./scripts/tail_logs.sh <log-group-name> "OutOfMemoryError" 1h
```

**Time formats:** `1h`, `30m`, `2d`, `5s`

---

### Workflow 5: Custom Error Analysis

**User Request:** "Find all authentication failures in the last 6 hours"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run custom Insights query
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 6 \
  'fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /(?i)(auth|authentication)/ and @message like /(?i)(fail|denied)/ | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100'
```

**Alternative using template query:**
```bash
# Step 1: Load query from template (if you have one defined)
QUERY=$(jq -r '.custom_queries.auth_failures' scripts/insights_queries.json)

# Step 2: Run the query
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 6 "$QUERY"
```

---

### Workflow 6: Analyze Performance Issues

**User Request:** "Find slow database queries in the last 24 hours"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: Use performance template query
QUERY=$(jq -r '.performance_analysis.slow_requests' scripts/insights_queries.json)

# Step 2: Run the query
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 24 "$QUERY"
```

**For RDS slow query logs:**
```bash
# Custom query for RDS slow query format
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh /aws/rds/instance/mydb/slowquery 24 \
  'fields @timestamp, query_time, lock_time, rows_examined, @message | parse @message /Query_time: (?<qt>[0-9.]+)\s+Lock_time: (?<lt>[0-9.]+).*\n(?<query>.*)/ | filter qt > 1.0 | sort qt desc | limit 20'
```

---

### Workflow 7: Investigate Recent Activity

**User Request:** "What's happening in my application right now?"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: List recent log streams to see activity
./scripts/list_log_streams.sh <log-group-name> 10

# Step 2: Tail recent logs
./scripts/tail_logs.sh <log-group-name> "" 10m

# Step 3: If errors are seen, analyze them
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1
```

---

### Workflow 8: Compare Error Rates

**User Request:** "Has the error rate increased in the last hour?"

**Execution Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: Get errors from last hour
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1

# Step 2: Get errors from previous hour for comparison
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 2 \
  'fields @timestamp | filter @message like /(?i)(error|fail|exception|critical)/ | stats count() as error_count by bin(1h)'
```

---

## Performance Optimization

**When combining this skill with other skills (especially gitlab-job-analyzer):**

See the complete optimization guide in the main CLAUDE.md documentation under "Performance Optimization for Cross-Skill Analysis".

**Key optimizations:**
1. **Parallel execution** - Run GitLab + AWS analysis simultaneously in one message
2. **Parse JSON once** - Capture output, parse multiple times with jq (don't re-run scripts)
3. **Smart targeting** - Analyze only log groups for failing runners/components identified in GitLab analysis
4. **Direct JSON output** - For typical analyses (10K+ errors), direct JSON is more efficient than state management

**Example - Optimized cross-skill analysis:**
```bash
# SINGLE MESSAGE - Parallel execution:
# Tool 1: AWS log analysis for component 1
./aws-log-analyzer/scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/component1 24

# Tool 2: AWS log analysis for component 2 (runs in parallel)
./aws-log-analyzer/scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/app/component2 24

# Tool 3: GitLab analysis (runs in parallel)
./gitlab-job-analyzer/scripts/analyze_recent_jobs.sh owner/repo --hours 24

# Then parse AWS output multiple ways without re-running:
echo "$AWS_OUTPUT" | jq '.total_errors'
echo "$AWS_OUTPUT" | jq '.by_severity'
echo "$AWS_OUTPUT" | jq '.top_errors[:5]'
echo "$AWS_OUTPUT" | jq '.hourly_distribution'
```

**Expected performance:**
- Optimized: 3-4 minutes, $0.75-0.85
- Non-optimized: 10+ minutes, $1.06+

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Case-Insensitive Patterns

**Logs may contain "error", "Error", or "ERROR"** - always use case-insensitive regex in CloudWatch Logs Insights queries:
- ✅ Use: `/(?i)error/` in Insights queries
- ❌ Avoid: `"ERROR"` filter patterns (case-sensitive)

### 2. Start with analyze_errors.sh

**For most error investigations**, use `analyze_errors.sh` first:
- Provides complete overview in one command
- Uses case-insensitive matching
- Excludes known noise patterns
- Shows time distribution

### 3. Use Template Queries

**Leverage `scripts/insights_queries.json`** for common analysis patterns:
- Pre-tested queries for common scenarios
- Easy to customize
- Consistent results

### 4. Filter Out Noise

**Noise patterns are defined in `scripts/noise-patterns.txt`:**
- GitLab Runner: `file already closed`
- AWS SDK throttling: `SlowDown`, `ThrottlingException`, `TooManyRequestsException`
- Rate limiting: `RequestLimitExceeded`, `Throttled`, `RequestThrottled`
- Provisioning: `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Enable noise filtering (uses patterns from noise-patterns.txt)
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24 --exclude-noise

# View all noise patterns
cat scripts/noise-patterns.txt

# Add custom patterns (edit the file)
echo "MyCustomNoisePattern" >> scripts/noise-patterns.txt
```

**Note:** Patterns are applied as case-insensitive regex patterns in CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.

### 5. Narrow Time Ranges for Performance

**Time range guidelines:**
- Initial investigation: 1-6 hours
- Trend analysis: 24 hours
- Historical analysis: 7 days maximum

**Narrower time ranges:**
- Reduce CloudWatch Logs Insights costs
- Improve query performance
- Faster results

### 6. Leverage Pattern Grouping

**Error messages often differ only in timestamps, IPs, or IDs:**
- "Error at 2026-02-06 15:30:45" vs "Error at 2026-02-06 16:45:12"
- "Connection failed to 192.168.1.100" vs "Connection failed to 192.168.1.200"

**Pattern normalization groups similar errors automatically:**
```bash
# The output includes both individual errors and pattern-grouped errors
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24

# Query pattern-grouped errors from saved state
./scripts/view_state.sh analyze_errors | jq '.top_errors_by_pattern'
```

**Pattern output structure:**
```json
{
  "pattern": "Error at <TIMESTAMP>",
  "total_count": 450,
  "occurrences": 12,
  "examples": [
    {"message": "Error at 2026-02-06 15:30:45", "count": 120},
    {"message": "Error at 2026-02-06 16:45:12", "count": 95}
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- See the "true" error count (not inflated by timestamp variations)
- Identify systemic issues vs one-time errors
- Reduce noise from UUID/IP variations

### 7. Use Tracing for Distributed Systems

**For microservices/distributed architectures:**
- Use `trace_request.sh` to follow requests across services
- Ensure request IDs are logged consistently
- Search across all related log groups with a common prefix

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: No Errors Found

**Cause:** Case-sensitive filter patterns don't match logs

**Solution:**
```bash
# ✅ Use Insights-based scripts (case-insensitive)
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 24
./scripts/find_recent_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1
```

---

### Problem: Too Many Results

**Cause:** Broad search across large time range

**Solution:**
```bash
# Step 1: Narrow time range
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1  # Last hour instead of 24

# Step 2: Filter by specific pattern
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 1 \
  'fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /(?i)OutOfMemory/ | limit 50'
```

---

### Problem: Query Timeout

**Cause:** Query too complex or time range too large

**Solution:**
```bash
# Step 1: Reduce time range
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group-name> 1  # Instead of 24

# Step 2: Simplify query (remove complex parsing)

# Step 3: Add more specific filters early in the query
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group-name> 1 \
  'fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /(?i)specific_error/ | stats count()'
```

---

### Problem: Log Group Not Found

**Cause:** Typo or wrong region

**Solution:**
```bash
# Step 1: List all log groups to verify name
./scripts/list_log_groups.sh

# Step 2: Search with prefix
./scripts/list_log_groups.sh /aws/application

# Step 3: Verify AWS region is correct (check AWS CLI config)
```

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### With Kubernetes Skill

**Workflow: Correlate K8s pod events with application logs**

```bash
# Step 1: Get pod name from kubernetes skill
# (kubernetes skill command)

# Step 2: Search CloudWatch logs for that pod
./scripts/trace_request.sh <pod-name> /aws/application 24
```

### With GitLab Skill

**Workflow: Investigate deployment-related errors**

```bash
# Step 1: Get commit SHA from gitlab skill
# (gitlab skill command)

# Step 2: Search logs for that deployment
./scripts/trace_request.sh <commit-sha> /aws/application 24

# Step 3: Analyze errors during deployment window
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh /aws/application/myapp 1
```

---

## Common Log Group Patterns

**AWS Services:**
```
/aws/lambda/<function-name>
/aws/rds/instance/<instance-id>/*
/aws/ecs/containerinsights/<cluster>
/aws/eks/<cluster>/cluster
/aws/apigateway/<api-id>/<stage>
```

**Application Logs:**
```
/aws/application/<app-name>
/var/log/messages
/aws/containerinsights/<cluster>/*
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Most Common Commands

**All commands output JSON by default. Add `--human` for human-readable format.**

```bash
# Analyze errors (JSON output) - RECOMMENDED
OUTPUT=$(./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24)
echo "$OUTPUT" | jq '.total_errors'

# Analyze errors (human-readable)
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24 --human

# Analyze errors with noise filtering and comparison
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24 --exclude-noise --compare-previous

# Find recent errors
./scripts/find_recent_errors.sh <log-group> 1

# Trace a request
./scripts/trace_request.sh <request-id> <log-group-prefix> 24

# Monitor in real-time
./scripts/tail_logs.sh <log-group>

# List log groups
./scripts/list_log_groups.sh

# Custom query
./scripts/run_insights_query.sh <log-group> 24 '<insights-query>'

# Parse JSON output
./scripts/analyze_errors.sh <log-group> 24 | jq '.total_errors'
./scripts/list_log_groups.sh | jq '.log_groups[].name'
```

### Time Formats

**For most scripts (hours):**
- `1` = last 1 hour
- `24` = last 24 hours
- `168` = last 7 days

**For tail_logs.sh (relative time):**
- `1h` = last hour
- `30m` = last 30 minutes
- `2d` = last 2 days
